# ScooterBay - Two Sided Marketplace Application

## The problem ScooterBay solves
E-Scooters have exploded in popularity over the past few years, especially with the adoption of E-Scooter renting services such as Lime making the EV mainstream. Many people are buying these E-Scooters brand new, and as it stands there is no two-sided-marketplace specifically dedicated to E-Scooters.

## Why it's a problem that needs solving
Consumers want to see what it's like to use an E-Scooter without buying brand new and without having to rent for an extended period. For example, if someone wants to see what it's like to commute to work on an E-Scooter every day for a month, they would either have to buy one brand new at a brand new price, or try renting through a service like Lime everyday (which would be very expensive over a month). A two-sided-marketplace will reduce this cost.

Many E-Scooters are being bought as impulse purchases. A two-sided-marketplace will reduce the cost of those impulse purchases (as they will be second hand), and allow those same purchases to be sold back to others.

Too many brand-new E-Scooters being purchased is also worse for sustainability than if more second-hand scooters are being bought as that will mean less scooters in landfill over the long term.
